microproj_1 is the first attempt at the code using the dictionary and original Ghat function.

Sparse projs 1 and 2 use the csr formats in their code. They have the same general layout as the microproj. They use a new code to calculate Ghat and the d(A) approximation.
    Sparse proj 2 is very similar to 1, but it's cleaned up and direct. sparse proj 1 has a slew of code used for testing and comparing stuff and its folder has some files
    not used in the main file. 
  Hopefully sparse proj2 and on will all be zip files

Sparse proj 3 is a work in progress and hopefully will introduce some sparsity patterns "in-between" A1 and A2, A2 and A3, and etc. and etc..
