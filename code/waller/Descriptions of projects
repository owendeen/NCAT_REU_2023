microproj_1 is the first attempt at the code using the dictionary and original Ghat function.

Sparse projs 1 and 2 use the csr formats in their code. They have the same general layout as the microproj. They use a new code to calculate Ghat and the d(A) approximation.
    Sparse proj 2 is very similar to 1, but it's cleaned up and direct. sparse proj 1 has a slew of code used for testing and comparing stuff and its folder has some files
    not used in the main file. It also introduces the laplacian_grid function and more.
  Hopefully sparse proj2 and on will all be zip files

Sparse proj 3 is a work in progress and hopefully will introduce some sparsity patterns "in-between" A1 and A2, A2 and A3, and etc. and etc..
    sparseproj_3 has a functioning prototype (emphasis on the proto) of a construction of an "in-between" of two sparsity patterns
        it's in the file: approximate_da_unfin2.py . You have to do alot of it manually. But given the Ghat of a pattern, it removes
        particular small values from the Ghat, and makes a new sparsity pattern from that which is inbetween Ak and A(k-1).
        this new sparsity pattern can be ran through the approximation part above it to give a new estimate!!!!

    new objective is to add that code to the actual function. after that, a sparse_proj4 will probably be started with lots
    of emphasis on making things FAST. If we only calculate things out to A2 sparsity pattern, they should be pretty quick
